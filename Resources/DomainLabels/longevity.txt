You really don't have a plan in place for long-term care, if you were no longer able to care for yourself.
You haven't done anything formal, but you think you could rely on family or friends to care for you.
You've made some financial provisions for long-term care, but you're not sure they're adequate.
You have long-term care insurance or a fund that is sufficient to ensure you can be self-reliant.
