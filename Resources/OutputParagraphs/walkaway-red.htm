<h1>Walkaway Mindset</h1>

<h2>Acting now to fund your future &ldquo;walkaway.&rdquo;</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($retirementPlanDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>This is a wake-up call, rather than an alarm: Your responses on this mindset indicate that it is time for action.</p>

<p>Now is the time to cultivate the habit of contributing regularly to a retirement account. Even investing&nbsp;a small percentage of your income can produce dramatic results.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Begin by assessing your retirement plan options. Determine what retirement plan(s) may be available to you from your employer, noting whether it is a defined benefit plan--which promises a specified monthly benefit when you retire--or a defined contribution plan that does not promise a specific amount of retirement benefit but allows you to manage your investments.</li>
	<li>If you own a business, a professional financial advisor can show you the full range of options available to you and your company.</li>
	<li>Next, determine how much you can contribute to your retirement account(s) each month.</li>
	<li>To do so, review your monthly budget, looking for opportunities to shift funds into retirement contributions.</li>
	<li>If you aren&rsquo;t currently using a cash flow tracker, please take the steps to do so effectively. They appear in the third section of &quot;Your Expansion Passport&reg;&quot; report.</li>
	<li>Most importantly, start saving&mdash;no matter how small the monthly amount will be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions can produce tangible progress toward the &quot;walkaway&quot; that you really want.</p>
