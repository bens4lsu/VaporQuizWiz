<h1>Accumulation Mindset</h1>

<h2>Executing your plan to achieve your goals.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($savesMoneyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve made a great start in this mindset. To move closer to your goal, (a) estimate as precisely as possible how much money you need for your goal and (b) document how much you have already saved toward your goal.</p>

<p>Gaining additional clarity on <strong><em>what you want to achieve</em></strong> and <strong><em>why you want to achieve it</em></strong> can prove motivating. Don&rsquo;t forget the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; because when you begin to veer off track (which you probably will), the &ldquo;why&rdquo; pulls you back to center&mdash;to what you really want.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>Next, take these simple but powerful steps to &ldquo;free up&rdquo; money to close the gap between what you have and what you need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Review your monthly budget and your individual expenses during the last 90 days.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Flag each budget line and expense as either &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential.&rdquo; Look particularly for &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as subscriptions you no longer need or entertainment expenses that may be larger than you realize.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Prioritize your spending by identifying expenses that you can either decrease or eliminate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve increased your cash flow, put this money aside monthly. Ideally, deposit it automatically in a separate account that you earmark for this goal.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These simple steps create a virtually automatic system that will move you more rapidly toward what you really want in life.</p>
