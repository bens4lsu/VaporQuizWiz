<h1>Readiness Mindset</h1>

<h2>The foundation that gives you confidence to make sound financial decisions.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($emergencyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Good news: The emergency fund you&rsquo;ve created represents an important first step in securing your financial future. Your answers indicate, though, that you would benefit from building a stronger safety net.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to focus on your goals&mdash;and achieving those goals will require you to identify opportunities to reduce your spending or increase your earning.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>We recommend that you continue or begin using a cash flow tracker to help with this. That tool will reveal areas in which you may spend more than you recognize&mdash;which means you&rsquo;ve discovered opportunities for improvement.</li>
	<li>Some of these opportunities may represent &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as cutting down on eating out or canceling monthly subscriptions you no longer need or want. Remember, <strong><em>you&#39;re</em></strong> in charge. No one is telling you what you must&nbsp;cut or change.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income (such as asking for a raise, looking at a different opportunity, or adding another form of income).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you see the full picture, you will find it much easier to make informed choices to help you move more rapidly toward what you really want in life.</p>
