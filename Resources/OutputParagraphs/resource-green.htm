<h1>Resource Mindset</h1>

<h2>Gain the insight to know not just how much you <em>make</em> but also how much you <em>keep</em>.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($cashFlowTrackerDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>By tracking your cash flow carefully, you&rsquo;ve taken a critically important step in ensuring that you stay on the right financial path.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, we suggest you schedule a recurring event in your calendar each month that designates the date and time that you will review that month&rsquo;s income and expenses, just to be sure that you continue your habit of monitoring these data carefully.</li>
	<li>Now may also be a good time to allocate extra revenue to your long-term goals.</li>
	<li>Consider setting up separate tracking and/or bank accounts for the goals you want to achieve, such as taking vacations, funding college, or purchasing or remodeling a house.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing so will let you continue moving toward <em>your </em>goals, the kind of life you really want.</p>
