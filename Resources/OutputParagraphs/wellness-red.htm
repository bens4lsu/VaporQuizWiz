<<h1>Wellness Mindset</h1>

<h2>Enhancing your health and wellness so you can enjoy your life and live it fully.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($healthDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Although investing in yourself may&nbsp;seem optional, doing so can yield dividends not only in the way you feel but also in your personal, business, and financial life.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>The good news is that you can make rapid progress if you focus your efforts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Begin by clarifying your goals for this mindset&mdash;<em><strong>what&rsquo;s truly most important to you</strong>? </em>Do you want to increase the odds that you can live and work healthily beyond conventional expectations? Do you want to maintain a healthy weight, enjoy more energy, or be fit enough to enjoy particular activities? The first step is to answer these questions so that you understand <strong>why</strong> you want to focus on health and fitness.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Next, find a way to track your progress toward your goals. Let&rsquo;s start with healthy eating. Assess your eating habits, to see if they&rsquo;re consistent with your health goals. If they aren&rsquo;t, look for an eating plan that fits your goals and preferences. Consider tracking what you eat.</li>
	<li>Then do the same with your activity&mdash;track your progress, whether with a fitness tracker, journal, or something else. Consider incorporating apps, devices, and personal trainers to make it <em><strong>fun </strong>to </em>exercise and eat healthily.</li>
	<li>And make your goals realistic. We suggest beginning with moderate exercise three times a week and a goal to eat healthily 4-5 days per week. Focus on making healthy eating and exercise a part of who you truly are.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t forget that wellness includes a <strong><em>mental </em></strong>as well as a <em><strong>physical</strong></em> component. Think about whether you need to manage stress more effectively--particularly if your family, career, or business places high demands on you. The American Institute of Stress states that over 80% of workers report experiencing work-related stress. If you&#39;re one of them, consider incorporating mindfulness and/or meditation techniques (many apps are available). Ensure that you seek support from friends and/or family and focus on positive coping strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>These simple actions can put you on a path to better wellness.&nbsp;</p>
