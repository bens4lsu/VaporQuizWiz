<h1>Purpose Mindset</h1>

<h2>Your plan to guide your &ldquo;walkaway&rdquo; future.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print  butNotLessThanZero($purposeNextChapterDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&#39;ve done a great job of clarifying your vision and plan for your &ldquo;next chapter,&rdquo; once you &quot;walkaway&quot; from your job or business. Articulating your goals for your next chapter clearly and making concrete plans to achieve them can help to ensure that it proves fulfilling for you.</p>

<p>As our lives change, sometimes our &quot;walkaway&quot; purpose changes. Reviewing your plan at least annually helps to ensure that your plan remains relevant. Make sure that your plans and strategies include considering the psychological aspects of retirement; how to stay connected socially; and how to handle health care costs, Medicare, and Social Security.</p>
