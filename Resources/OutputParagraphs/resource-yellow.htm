<p>Your answers indicate that you&rsquo;ve done a good job of establishing the habit of tracking your income and your expenses. That&rsquo;s a critically important step in securing your financial future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>We suggest you now take some simple additional steps that can help you free up cash flow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Begin by reassessing your goals: For what do you really want to use your money?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Form a monthly habit of tracking your expenses, to ensure that you&rsquo;re on the right road. We suggest you schedule a recurring event in your calendar each month that designates the date and time that you will review that month&rsquo;s income and expenses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gather your pay stubs, credit card statements, and bank statements (including debit card statements) for that month.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Look closely at individual expenditures, flagging each one as either &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential.&rdquo; Look particularly for &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as subscriptions you no longer need or entertainment expenses that may be larger than you realize.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Prioritize your spending by identifying expenses that you can either decrease or eliminate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income (such as asking for a raise, looking at a different opportunity, or adding another form of income).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These simple steps will help you free cash flow to fund the things you really want, <strong><em>your</em></strong> goals.</p>
