<h1>Readiness Mindset</h1>

<h2>The foundation that gives you confidence to make sound financial decisions.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($emergencyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Although there&rsquo;s no need for alarm, your responses on this mindset do indicate that it is time for action. Building a solid foundation will require an emergency fund for life&rsquo;s unexpected changes and challenges. Remember, you had a reason for completing Your Expansion Passport&reg;. Maybe you realized that it&rsquo;s time to shore up your finances, take a fabulous trip, or put money away for college.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>Whatever your reason for completing Your Expansion Passport&reg;, we suggest that you may have enough for what you <em><strong>need</strong></em>, just not everything you <em><strong>want</strong></em>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Begin by focusing on smart budgeting. That may seem overwhelming or mysterious, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</li>
	<li>The first step is to use a cash flow tracker (you can find several free ones online) to help you cut spending and start saving.</li>
	<li>Some of the opportunities it reveals may represent &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as cutting down on eating out or canceling monthly subscriptions you no longer need or want. Remember, <strong><em>you&#39;re</em></strong> in charge. No one is telling you what you must cut or change.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income (such as asking for a raise, looking at a different opportunity, or adding another form of income).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you see the full picture, you will likely find it much easier to make informed choices to help you move more rapidly toward what you really want in your life.</p>
