<h1>Accumulation Mindset</h1>

<h2>Executing your plan to achieve your goals.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($savesMoneyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Your answers on this mindset indicate that you do need to take action. But don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. You can take simple steps to move toward <em><strong>having what you really want in your life</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Where should you start? By clarifying your goals.</p>

<p>Do you want to take a fabulous trip, save for your child&rsquo;s education, or just feel more financially secure? Gaining clarity on <em><strong>what</strong></em> you want to achieve and <em><strong>why you want to achieve it</strong></em> can prove motivating.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; because when you begin to veer off track (which you likely will), the &ldquo;why&rdquo; pulls you back to center, to what you really want.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>Next, take these simple but powerful steps to &ldquo;free up&rdquo; money to save for your goals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Begin by gathering your credit card statements, bank statements (including debit card statements), and pay stubs for the previous 90 days.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use this information to calculate an average monthly expenditure over the last 90 days.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now, let&rsquo;s &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; a bit by looking at individual expenses during these 90 days. Flag each one as either &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential.&rdquo; Look particularly for &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as monthly subscriptions you no longer need or entertainment expenses that may be larger than you realize.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Prioritize your spending by identifying expenses that you can either decrease or eliminate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve increased your cash flow, put this money aside monthly&mdash;ideally, deposit it automatically in a separate account that you earmark for this goal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These simple steps create a virtually automatic system that will move you more rapidly toward <em><strong>what you really want in your life</strong></em>.</p>
