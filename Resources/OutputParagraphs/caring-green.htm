<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($accessDocsDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve taken critical steps to protect your loved ones in case you were out of commission. We suggest that you ensure that your system remains up to date.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>To ensure your loved ones will have what they need, even if conditions change:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add assets, liabilities, and key documents to the binder or vault in which your information is compiled as soon as they&rsquo;re acquired and ensure that you review and update the information at least annually, to keep it current.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to review all of the documents with a professional financial advisor to confirm that everything you need is in place and up to date.</li>
</ul>

<p>This small investment ensures that your loved ones will remain protected.</p>
