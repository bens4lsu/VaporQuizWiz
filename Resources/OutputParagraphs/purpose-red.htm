<h1>Purpose Mindset</h1>

<h2>Your plan to guide your &ldquo;walkaway&rdquo; future.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print  butNotLessThanZero($purposeNextChapterDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Your answers suggest that you would benefit from thinking about what you really want for the &ldquo;next chapter,&rdquo; once you &quot;walkaway&quot; from your job or business. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that by 2024&mdash;when the youngest Baby Boomers will be 60 and the oldest will be 78&mdash;the US labor force will include 13 million people aged 65 or older.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>We encourage you to consider how you really want to spend your retirement.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Would you like to join these older individuals in the labor force by entering an &ldquo;encore career&rdquo; or starting your own business?</li>
	<li>Would you prefer to contribute by taking care of loved ones or engaging in volunteer or charitable work?</li>
	<li>Do you see your future retirement as a period to enjoy some well-earned leisure? Crafting clear (although potentially changing) purpose proves key to &ldquo;walkaway&nbsp;success.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Make sure you&#39;ve considered how to maintain social relationships and/or form new ones during retirement. Even close ties wane if they aren&#39;t maintained&mdash;and social relationships prove key not only for remaining engaged but also for receiving critically important social support during your retirement years.</li>
	<li>Think, too, about the emotional aspect of retirement. If work has provided a key source of identity for you, you may need to think consciously about how to deal with that loss. One way to do that is to ensure that you remain active, whether through paid employment, volunteering, or increased family/friend time.</li>
	<li>Ensure that your plans include well-defined strategies for managing your health care costs, as well as Social Security and Medicare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever your goals, articulating them clearly and making concrete plans to achieve them can help ensure your &ldquo;next chapter&rdquo; proves fulfilling for you.</p>
