<p>Your answers reveal an opportunity to improve your financial situation by freeing up cash flow. Remember: It&rsquo;s not just how much money you make that determines your financial situation but also how much money you keep.</p>

<p>Often, we miss opportunities to increase cash flow because we&rsquo;re unaware of how much we&rsquo;re spending. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to track your spending so that you become keenly aware of how much money flows through your hands.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>The good news is that you can take simple steps, right now, to identify where and how to increase cash flow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Begin by gathering your credit card statements, bank statements (including debit card statements), and pay stubs for the previous 90 days.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use this information to calculate an average monthly expenditure over the last 90 days.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now, let&rsquo;s &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; a bit by looking at individual expenses during these 90 days. Flag each one as either &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential.&rdquo; Look particularly for &ldquo;easy wins,&rdquo; such as subscriptions you no longer need or entertainment expenses that may be larger than you realize.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Prioritize your spending by identifying expenses that you can either decrease or eliminate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Monitor your expenses monthly, continuing to identify opportunities to increase your cash flow.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income (such as asking for a raise, looking at a different opportunity, or adding another form of income).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These simple steps can free up cash so that you can save for things you really want, achieve your goals more rapidly, and decrease stress in the process.</p>
