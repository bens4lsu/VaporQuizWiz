<p>Congratulations on making progress toward ensuring that you can afford long-term care if it becomes necessary. Now it&#39;s time to take the next steps.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>We suggest that you begin by reassessing your goals. What kind of long-term care would you prefer?</p>

<p>Be sure that you articulate goals for different health scenarios. Do you want to</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stay at home at all costs?</li>
	<li>Live with a family member?</li>
	<li>Have outside assistance or help from a loved one?</li>
	<li>Be in a vibrant retirement community or only move if and when care is needed?</li>
</ul>

<p>Although few of us want to talk about these questions, they prove critically important to address.</p>

<p>Next, it&rsquo;s time to (a) calculate your need, (b) define your risk, and potentially (c) transfer your risk.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Calculating the need means coming up with a number that represents the likely cost of long-term care. Be sure that you know the cost of care in your state and/or local area.</li>
	<li>Calculating the risk means measuring the difference between your total needs and the savings and protections (insurance) that you currently have in place.</li>
	<li>To do that, use an insurance calculator or speak with a financial advisor. To transfer your risk, consider putting long-term care insurance in place or augmenting your current coverage.</li>
	<li>In addition to measuring your need and risk, don&rsquo;t forget to also ensure that you have wills, trusts, powers of attorney, etc. in place to protect the ones you love the most.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these steps now will provide peace of mind for you and your loved ones.</p>
