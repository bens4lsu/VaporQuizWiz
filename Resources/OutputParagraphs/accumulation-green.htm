<h1>Accumulation Mindset</h1>

<h2>Executing your plan to achieve your goals.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($savesMoneyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done a wonderful job of turning your goals into action. We suggest a few additional steps to ensure that your actions remain aligned with your goals.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Action Steps</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Review your important goals at least annually. Maintaining clarity on <em><strong>what you want to achieve</strong></em> and <strong><em>why you want to achieve it </em></strong>can prove motivating.</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t forget the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; because when you start to veer off track (and you probably will), the &ldquo;why&rdquo; pulls you back to center&mdash;and what you really want becomes reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>These actions can propel you toward your goals even more rapidly.</p>
