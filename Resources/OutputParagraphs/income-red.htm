But there&rsquo;s not need to panic: We&rsquo;ll outline steps you can take right now to help you <em><strong>move more rapidly toward the life you want</strong></em>.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>First, reassess your goals, to ensure that you know what you want your &ldquo;next chapter&rdquo; to look like.</li>
	<li>Review the section in &quot;Your Walkaway Passport&reg;&quot; report on planning for the next chapter and take any steps that we suggest there, to make sure that you have a clear picture of where you&rsquo;re headed and a concrete plan for getting there.</li>
	<li>Once you&rsquo;ve articulated a clear vision, the next step is to quantify the assets that you have available to produce a retirement income stream. These assets can include investments, retirement funds, pensions, savings, and social security.</li>
	<li>Next, estimate your monthly income needs in retirement, ensuring that you consider possible inflation, medical costs, living expenses, and discretionary spending. Doing so can be daunting&mdash;often, this provides a good reason to work with a professional financial planner to ensure you know your <strong><em>real </em></strong>number. Don&rsquo;t forget: You should maintain a separate emergency fund, even in retirement. Estimating &ldquo;what you&rsquo;ll have&rdquo; and &ldquo;what you&rsquo;ll need&rdquo; in this way can illuminate gaps in your income plan and opportunities for improvement.</li>
	<li>Consider consulting a financial advisor to help you clarify your goals further and plan to achieve them. The concluding section of this report provides relevant information.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps can help ensure you can enjoy the &quot;walkaway&quot; that you really want.</p>
