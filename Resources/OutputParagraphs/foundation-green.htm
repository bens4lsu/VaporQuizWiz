<h1>Foundation Mindset</h1>

<h2>Protecting yourself and those who are important to you.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($keyProtectionsDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done an excellent job of putting key protections in place, for yourself and your loved ones. A few additional steps can&nbsp; ensure that you continue to provide a safety net for your loved ones.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>We suggest&nbsp;you review these key protections at least annually, to ensure they remain sufficient if your circumstances change.</li>
	<li>Now is also the time to verify you have updated wills, trusts, powers of attorney, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These actions can ensure that you and your loved ones have a firm foundation, regardless of what transpires.</p>
