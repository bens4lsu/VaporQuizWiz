<h1>Caring Mindset</h1>

<h2>Sharing key information with your loved ones.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($accessDocsDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Your answers suggest that you need to take action to ensure that your loved ones could find and access all the documents and accounts that they would need (bank accounts, investment accounts, legal documents, etc.) if you were out of commission. The good news is that you have identified the need and can easily rectify the problem. Whether you collect the information in a physical binder or a digital vault, it&rsquo;s important to keep everything in one place. Ensure that your loved ones know where that place is and be sure that they can access it easily and securely.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>The task might <strong><em>seem</em></strong> daunting, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Here are the key things you need to compile:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A copy of the most recent version of your will. In some states, only original wills can be filed&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the case, keep the original in a safe place that your loved ones know how to access. Keep 1-2 additional copies.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A copy of any trusts and/or powers of attorney.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A list of insurance policies and investments, retirement accounts, and financial liabilities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A list of your bank accounts, including checking and savings accounts and safe deposit boxes. Be sure it includes institution names, account numbers, and the name of any particular individuals with whom you deal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A list of all accounts for which you have monthly obligations, including mortgage payments and utility bills.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A list of online accounts and passwords for all the above (a secure password manager/vault can be an easy way to compile this).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Add assets, liabilities, and key documents to the binder or digital vault as soon as they&rsquo;re acquired and review the information annually, to keep it current.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, then, the task of caring for your loved ones proves far less difficult than it might seem.</p>
