<h1>Walkaway Mindset</h1>

<h2>Acting now to fund your future &ldquo;walkaway.&rdquo;</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($retirementPlanDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You have made tremendous progress on this mindset. Now is the time to take additional steps to ensure that you at least maintain, or even increase, your current trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>To keep moving toward the &quot;walkaway&quot; you want:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continue monitoring your progress and ensure that you adjust your retirement plan participation at least annually.</li>
	<li>As your income increases, so should the funds you put away for retirement.</li>
	<li>Be sure to respond appropriately to changing goals, time horizons, and market conditions.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income (such as asking for a raise, looking at a different opportunity, or adding another form of income).</li>
	<li>As you put money away in your retirement plan, be sure your money works as hard as you do. When you review your investment options and the diversification within your plan, you can assess whether that is the case&mdash;especially if you enlist the assistance of a qualified financial advisor.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps can position you to do the things you really want when you &quot;walkaway.&quot;</p>
