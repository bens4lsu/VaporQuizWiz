<p>It appears that you&rsquo;re not currently working with a financial advisor. If you have some of the other mindsets on track&mdash;such as establishing an emergency fund and putting key protections in place for you and your loved ones&mdash;then it may be time to consider partnering with a financial advisor.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>Here are some important actions to help you create a productive partnership:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One big preparation for forming this partnership will be to clarify your goals by identifying and writing down what you <strong><em>really</em></strong> want in your life.</li>
	<li>You might also benefit from considering <em><strong>why</strong> </em>you haven&#39;t yet worked with a financial advisor.</li>
	<li>A good place to start would be to consider whether this is really a &ldquo;why&rdquo; or a &ldquo;how&rdquo; issue: In other words, do you question <em><strong>why</strong></em> you should work with a financial advisor (whether you need one), or is the issue more a question of not knowing <strong><em>how</em></strong> to work with a financial advisor or how to find one who will be a good fit for you?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to reach out to a financial advisor to find out the &ldquo;why or how&rdquo; or to get assistance in defining your goals and putting a solid financial plan in place, see the concluding section of this report for information on how to do so.</p>
