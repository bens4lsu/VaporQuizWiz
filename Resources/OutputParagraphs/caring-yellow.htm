<h1>Caring Mindset</h1>

<h2>Sharing key information with your loved ones.</h2>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<div>To ensure your loved ones will have everything they need, confirm that the information is compiled in a binder or digital vault and check to see that it includes the following:</div>

<ul>
	<li>A copy of the most recent version of your will. In some states, only original wills can be filed&mdash;if that&rsquo;s the case, ensure that the original remains in a safe place that your loved ones know how to access. Keep 1-2 additional copies.</li>
	<li>A copy of any trusts and/or powers of attorney.</li>
	<li>A list of insurance policies and investment and retirement accounts.</li>
	<li>A list of all financial liabilities.</li>
	<li>A list of your bank accounts, including checking and savings accounts and safe deposit boxes. Be sure that the list includes institution names and account numbers, as well as the name of any particular individuals with whom you deal at that financial institution.</li>
	<li>A list of all accounts for which you have monthly obligations, including mortgage payments, utility bills, and the like.</li>
	<li>A list of online accounts and passwords for them (having a secure password manager/vault can be an easy way to compile this).</li>
	<li>Add assets, liabilities, and key documents to the binder or digital vault as soon as they&rsquo;re acquired and review the information at least annually, to keep it current.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These caring actions prove critical for ensuring you protect your loved ones.</p>
