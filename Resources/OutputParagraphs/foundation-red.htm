<h2>Protecting yourself and those who are important to you.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($keyProtectionsDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Your answers reveal that your situation does require action. But the good news is that focused action can put in place the protections that you and your loved ones need.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s clarify your goals and reassess your current position. Once you&rsquo;ve gotten clear on your goals, it&rsquo;s time to figure out what you really require out of an insurance policy, so those goals aren&rsquo;t endangered if your circumstances change.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The steps to clarifying your goals and reassessing your current position involve (a) calculating your need and (b) defining your risk.</li>
	<li>Calculating your need means coming up with a number that represents how much you and/or your loved ones would need if you were no longer able to work.</li>
	<li>Calculating the risk means measuring the difference between your total needs and the savings and protections (insurance) you currently have in place.</li>
	<li>To do that, use an insurance calculator or speak with a financial advisor.</li>
	<li>In addition to measuring your need and risk, don&rsquo;t forget to also ensure you have wills, trusts, powers of attorney, etc. in place to protect the ones you love the most.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these steps can do a great deal to provide peace of mind to you and your loved ones if the unexpected happens.&nbsp;</p>
