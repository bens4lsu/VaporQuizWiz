<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print  butNotLessThanZero($planLongTermCareDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You have done a good job of planning for long-term care. You can take pride in this accomplishment: As healthcare costs rise, ensuring that you can provide long-term care becomes increasingly important.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Because these rising costs change your risk profile, review your long-term care protection at least annually. Reassess your risk to ensure that you maintain appropriate coverage.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to share your long-term care wishes with a loved one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these additional steps now will ensure continued peace of mind for you and your loved ones.</p>
