<p>Choosing a qualified, supportive advisor who can help you achieve your goals can prove vitally important in ensuring that you get the things you really want in life. We&#39;re delighted that you have taken this important step.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>We suggest you think carefully about how you and your advisor are working together. To do that, first clarify what you expect from an advisor. For example,&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>How frequently do you want to meet with him or her (at least annually)?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What kind of assistance are you looking for in achieving your goals?&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do you prefer an advisor who holds a particular type of education, experience, or certification?&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>How do you want your advisor to be compensated? We suggest that you should expect to pay a financial professional for good advice, as you would a doctor. Neither should work for free.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Then, look carefully at your relationship with your financial advisor to assess whether he or she meets your expectations. Are you and your advisor working in partnership? Do you truly feel that he or she represents your best interests?&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If your answers suggest that you aren&rsquo;t currently working with the right financial professional, look for a financial planner who can meet your criteria and work in partnership with you.</p>

<p>When you meet with a prospective advisor, bring a list of both your expectations and questions that you want him or her to answer. Please see the conclusion of this report for more information on how to make this process effective.</p>
