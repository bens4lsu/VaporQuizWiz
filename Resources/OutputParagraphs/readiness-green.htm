<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($emergencyDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve made tremendous progress in establishing an emergency fund that can provide a &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; when unexpected expenses arise. We encourage you to feel proud of having this important protection in place. Now let&#39;s look at where you should focus next.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<ul>
	<li>We urge you to conduct a quarterly &ldquo;check-up&rdquo; to ensure your emergency fund remains sufficient as your circumstances change.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and set bigger goals for yourself, such as more free time with family or friends or increased contributions to your &ldquo;walkaway&nbsp;fund.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Continue to measure your progress toward your goals and reassess what&rsquo;s really important to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these steps will ensure that your emergency fund remains adequate, even if your circumstances change.</p>
