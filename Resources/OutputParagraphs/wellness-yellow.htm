<h1>Wellness Mindset</h1>

<h2>Enhancing your health and wellness so you can enjoy your life and live it fully.</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($healthDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>Congratulations on taking concrete steps for a healthy future! To continue your progress, begin by clarifying your goals for this mindset&mdash;<em><strong>what&rsquo;s truly most important to you?</strong> </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do you want to increase the odds that you can live and work healthily beyond conventional expectations?</li>
	<li>Do you want to maintain a healthy weight, enjoy more energy, or be fit enough to enjoy particular activities?</li>
</ul>

<p>Gaining clarity on <em><strong>why</strong></em> you want to improve your health or fitness can prove motivating.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>Once you know where you&rsquo;re heading and <strong><em>why</em></strong>, take steps to increase your chances of success:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop both support and accountability, perhaps by hiring a personal trainer or enlisting the help of a friend.</li>
	<li>Because nutrition comprises the biggest piece of our fitness quest, we suggest that you make it fun to learn about different nutrition &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; and set a goal of eating healthily 80% of the time&mdash;none of us is perfect! Consider tracking what you eat, either in a journal or via an online tracker or app.</li>
	<li>Do the same with your activity. Whether you use a fitness tracker, journal, or something else, track your progress. Incorporating apps, devices, and personal trainers to make it <strong><em>fun </em></strong>to exercise and eat healthily.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t forget that wellness includes a <strong><em>mental </em></strong>as well as a <strong><em>physical</em></strong> component. Think about whether you need to manage stress more effectively--particularly if your family, career, or business places high demands on you. The American Institute of Stress states that over 80% of workers report experiencing work-related stress. If you&#39;re one of them, consider incorporating mindfulness and/or meditation techniques. Ensure&nbsp;you seek support from friends and/or family and focus on positive coping strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions can put you on a path to better wellness.</p>
