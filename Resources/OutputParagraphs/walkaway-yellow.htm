<h1>Walkaway Mindset</h1>

<h2>Acting now to fund your future &ldquo;walkaway.&rdquo;</h2>

<h2>Your Distance From Your Goal: <!--?php print butNotLessThanZero($retirementPlanDistance); ?--></h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done a good job of beginning your journey toward your retirement savings goal. But if you&rsquo;re like most of us, you&rsquo;re probably asking yourself a critical question: &ldquo;Am I saving enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where a qualified financial advisor can prove extremely helpful; he or she can partner with you to determine not only whether you&rsquo;re saving enough but also whether you&rsquo;ve diversified your assets correctly to ensure you are taking the appropriate risk for your current age, goals, and/or &ldquo;walkaway&rdquo; age.</p>

<h2>Key Action Steps</h2>

<p>In addition to partnering with a qualified advisor, these actions can speed your progress:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As you put money away in your retirement plan, be sure your money works as hard as you do. When you review your investment options and the diversification within your plan, you can assess whether that is the case&mdash;especially if you enlist the assistance of a financial advisor.</li>
	<li>Review the fourth section of this report, on partnering with a financial advisor, and follow the recommendations there.</li>
	<li>This may also be a good time to look at your current career and/or income to see if there are ways to earn additional income or pursue other opportunities.</li>
	<li>Continue monitoring your progress on this mindset, ensuring that you adjust your retirement plan participation at least annually so that you respond appropriately to changing goals, time horizons, and market conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps can position you to do the things you really want when you &quot;walkaway.&quot;</p>
